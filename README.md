## Inspiration: 
If a person wants to see the environmental impact of the recycle they have made, most of the sites they can find on the internet calculate it in large scales. I made a different version of these calculators so one person can calculate it easily.

## Project Description:
My purpose in this project is to motivate people to recycle. I want to create an app where people can track calculate the impact of their recycling. An application that allows them to see the environmental impact they made with the products they recycle. This calculator will work with predetermined scales.



## Challenges: 
For this project besides what I've know I learned a new environment (QT). Learning took some time and countless searching but I'm pleased with the result.

## Accomplishment (what you have learned): 
I learned a new environment and I think that it increased my interest in the coding as it is a more design-based program.

## Future Direction: 
I would love to add more items to calculate. Right now I'm using another calculator that calculates tons of materials as a resource, in the future I would like to use my own data. I also would like to add some functions like sharing the result you got on the social media.
